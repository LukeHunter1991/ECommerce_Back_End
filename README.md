 ## Description
 In this program I built the back end to an E Commerce platform. This allows a user to run Get, Post, Put, and Delete routes using insomnia. This will allow the user to query the databse which is made up of tables for Products, Categories, Tags, and Product Tags. I did this to gain a deeper understanding of Sequelize including models, and associations between tables.

## Installation
In order to use this program it's best to use Insomnia to make requests and receive responses.

## Usage
A user can launch the program by typing npm run seed to seed data into the database and then npm start to run the application. The user will then utilise an API development platform like Insomnia to run GET/PUT/POST/DELETE routes.
